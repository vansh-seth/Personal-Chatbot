# Personal Chatbot

This repository contains a simple personal chatbot built using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model and Gradio for the user interface. The chatbot allows for interactive conversations and saves the conversation history to a text file.

## Features
- **Interactive Chat:** Engage in conversations with the chatbot using OpenAI's language model.
- **Conversation History:** Automatically saves the conversation history in a text file.
- **Customizable UI:** Simple user interface built with Gradio.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Install the required packages:
  ```bash
  pip install openai gradio
  ```

### Configuration
1. **OpenAI API Setup:**  
   Replace `"add base"` with your OpenAI API base URL and `"add your key"` with your OpenAI API key in the script.
   ```python
   openai.api_base = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
   openai.api_key = "your-api-key"
   ```

2. **Run the Chatbot:**
   ```bash
   python your_script.py
   ```
   Replace `your_script.py` with the filename of your Python script.

### How It Works
- **Message Handling:** The chatbot saves the first message as the filename (limited to the first 20 characters) to store the conversation.
- **Conversation Logging:** Each message and its corresponding response are logged in a text file named after the first message.

### Usage
- Launch the chatbot UI:
  - After running the script, a Gradio UI will open in your browser where you can start chatting with the bot.
  - The chat history is displayed, and you can interact by typing messages.

### Example Usage
1. **Start a conversation:** Type your message in the textbox and click "Send."
2. **View conversation history:** The conversation history is stored in a `.txt` file with the filename based on the first message you typed.
